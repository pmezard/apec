<h1>APEC</h1>
<p>
	The APEC is an official French board for middle management/executive jobs:<br/>
	<a href="http://apec.fr">http://apec.fr</a><br/><br/>
	Here is an experiment on data collection, geocoding and indexing. Job
	offers are scraped at least once a day, geocoded then indexed both
	textually and spatially. Search them using:<br/>
	<a href="search">search</a><br/>
	Or visualize their spatial distribution:<br/>
	<a href="density">density</a><br/><br/>
	Keep in mind this service lives on a crowded RaspberryPi2, be gentle.
