# What is it?

The APEC is an official French job board for middle management/executive jobs:

  [http://apec.fr](http://apec.fr)

This project is an experiment on data collection, geocoding, indexing, analysis and visualization, based on APEC job offers. The result is interesting because:
 * It provides real data to play with, with all its flaws (typo, mismatched fields, unsanitized inputs, etc.) 
 * Recruitment is an important and poorly adressed topic and job offers reflect that. They are often badly written, by people unrelated to targeted fields and carry little information in practice.
 * It has to run on a Raspberry Pi 2 which brings amusing technical constraints.
